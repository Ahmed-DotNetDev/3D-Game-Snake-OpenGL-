<p>3D Game Snake OpenGL With C++ OpenGL</p>

# Idea of game 
<p>
<strong>Set up the environment:</strong> Initialize the OpenGL context and set up the window for rendering.
Define the snake's position and movement: Create a data structure to represent the snake, such as an array or linked list of segments. Each segment should have position and direction information.

<strong>Create the game world:</strong> Set up the 3D environment by defining the boundaries and obstacles of the game world. This can be done using simple geometric shapes like cubes or custom models.
<strong>Implement user input:</strong> Capture user input to control the snake's movement. Use keyboard inputs to change the direction of the snake.
Render the snake and game objects: Use OpenGL functions to render the snake and other game objects in 3D. You can use basic geometric shapes or textured models to represent the snake and objects.

<strong>Handle collision detection:</strong> Implement collision detection to check if the snake collides with obstacles or itself. Use bounding box or more complex collision algorithms depending on the complexity of your game objects.
Update the game logic: Update the position and movement of the snake based on user input and handle collision events accordingly. Modify the snake's segments and update the game state.

<strong>Update the display:</strong> Render the updated positions of the snake and game objects to the screen. Use OpenGL functions to redraw the scene with the updated positions and rotations.
Add game features: Implement additional features such as scoring, power-ups, levels, and game over conditions. Enhance the gameplay to make it engaging and challenging.
Game loop: Set up a game loop that continuously updates the game logic, handles user input, and renders the scene. This ensures smooth gameplay and real-time response.
